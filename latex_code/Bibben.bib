abstract = {A state-space averaging method for modelling switching dc-to-dc converters for both continuous and discontinuous conduction mode is developed. In each case the starting point is the unified state-space representation, and the end result is a complete linear circuit model, for each conduction mode, which correctly represents all essential features, namely, the input, output, and transfer properties (static dc as well as dynamic ac small-signal). While the method is generally applicable to any switching converter, it is extensively illustrated for the three common power stages (buck, boost, and buck-boost). The results for these converters are then easily tabulated owing to the fixed equivalent circuit topology of their canonical circuit model. The insights that emerge from the general state-space modelling approach lead to the design of new converter topologies through the study of generic properties of the cascade connection of basic buck and boost converters.},

abstract = {<p>The letter presents an exact small-signal discrete-time model for digitally controlled pulsewidth modulated (PWM) dc-dc converters operating in constant frequency continuous conduction mode (CCM) with a single effective A/D sampling instant per switching period. The model, which is based on well-known approaches to discrete-time modeling and the standard Z-transform, takes into account sampling, modulator effects and delays in the control loop, and is well suited for direct digital design of digital compensators. The letter presents general results valid for any CCM converter with leading or trailing edge PWM. Specific examples, including approximate closed-form expressions for control-to-output transfer functions are given for buck and boost converters. The model is verified in simulation using an independent system identification approach.</p>},

abstract = {A powerful reference for anyone working in power electronics The topic, switched-mode power converters, has gathered immense interest for the power electronics community worldwide. This is mostly due to the number of emerging applications that benefit from the availability of low-cost digital technology, and therefore becomes competitive against mainstream techniques. This book is focused on the fundamental aspects of analysis, modeling and design of digital control loops around high-frequency switched-mode power converters in a systematic and rigorous manner. The objectives are to enable the reader to understand, analyze, model, design, and implement digital feedback loops around power converters, from system-level transfer function formulations to practical implementation details. Both theory and practical examples of the topics treated are addressed. The latter make extensive use of Matlab simulations, and several Matlab examples are provided alongside the exposition. Some of the other features of this book are: . A comprehensive treatment of digital control theory for power converters . Verilog and VHDL sample codes . Chapters 1-6 will enable readers to successfully analyze, model, design, and implement voltage, current, or multi-loop digital feedback lops around switched-mode power converters . Practical examples are used throughout the book to illustrate applications of the techniques developed This book covers the theory and design practice of control in a comprehensive way, tackling everything from the most recent advances to the more advanced topics. .},

abstract = {<p>This paper presents a new bilinear discrete-time modeling method for switching power converter circuits. The method utilizes a new approximation of the matrix exponential involved in the exact discrete-time models. Compared to the conventional bilinear discrete-time models or to the continuous-time averaged models, the new bilinear models provide a means for more reliable and accurate stability and transient response prediction. They also lend themselves better to digital control design than do the exact discrete-time models due to their simplicity. The modeling method is validated by several example converters, for which traditional averaged models and conventional bilinear discrete-time models fail to predict the stability characteristics correctly.</p>},

abstract = {<p>This paper discusses the presence of steady-state limit cycles in digitally controlled pulse-width modulation (PWM) converters, and suggests conditions on the control law and the quantization resolution for their elimination. It then introduces single-phase and multi-phase controlled digital dither as a means of increasing the effective resolution of digital PWM (DPWM) modules, allowing for the use of low resolution DPWM units in high regulation accuracy applications. Bounds on the number of bits of dither that can be used in a particular converter are derived. Finally, experimental results confirming the theoretical analysis are presented.</p>},

abstract = {<p>A simple method for achieving tight output voltage regulation in digitally controlled low-power dc-dc switch-mode power supplies with low-resolution digital pulse-width modulators (DPWM) is introduced. By utilizing a non-zero scheme for coding the output voltage error, an inherent quasi sigma-delta modulation effect improving effective DPWM resolution is obtained. The effectiveness of the method is experimentally verified on a 400 kHz, 5 V to 1.8 V, 5 W digitally-controlled buck converter. Using a 6-bit DPWM and the new coding scheme only, undesirable low-frequency limit-cycle oscillations (LCO), existing in conventional designs, are eliminated and tight output voltage regulation obtained.</p>},
