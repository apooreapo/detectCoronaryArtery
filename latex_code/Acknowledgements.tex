While reaching the end of this journey, I wish to thank those ones who have contributed to this thesis project, though keeping myself solely responsible for the contents of this report.

Starting from KTH, I would like to thank my head supervisor and examiner Staffan Norrga, for his support and motivation, as well as for granting me the chance to complete my studies at KTH with a thesis in the field of power electronics. 

Furthermore, I would like to thank Megger Sweden AB for giving me the opportunity to conduct my thesis project within their team. Primarily, I would like to thank Pari Ibrahim for accepting the role of my supervisor, as well as my colleague Takeshi for his comments on my final report. I would also like to express my gratitude to my friend, colleague and mentor in power electronics Zoran for the endless inspiration and his invaluable input at every stage of the project.

From the close ones, allow me to thank my family for believing in me and supporting me by all means. Next, let me thank my friends Panos and Anastasia for our inspirational discussions. Closing, I do want to thank my partner Vasiliki for her love and encouragement.
